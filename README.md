# QDriverStation

The QDriverStation is a cross-platform and open-source alternative to the FRC Driver Station. It allows you to operate FRC robots with the major operating systems (Windows, macOS and GNU/Linux). 

The actual code that operates a FRC robot is found in a separate repository ([ds-rs](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/ds-rs)) and is written in Rust by [Kaitlyn Kenwell](https://github.com/Redrield).

For the moment, this project is under heavy development. The user interface will be built from the ground-up to use newer Qt/QML technologies. Integration with [ds-rs](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/ds-rs) is underway.

## Note

This version of the QDriverStation only works with 2020 robots. If you need to drive an older robot, check the [legacy](https://github.com/FRC-Utilites/QDriverStation-Legacy) version.
