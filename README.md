# QDriverStation-Rust

This project aims to integrate the UI of the [QDriverStation](https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/QDriverStation) with [ds-rs]https://github.com/first-rust-competition/ds-rs, a library written by [Kaitlyn Kenwell](https://github.com/Redrield).

:warning: For the moment, this project is under heavy development. The user interface will be built from the ground-up to use newer Qt/QML technologies. Integration with [ds-rs](https://github.com/first-rust-competition/ds-rs) is underway. If you need to drive a robot, check the [original QDriverStation](https://github.com/FRC-Utilities/QDriverStation).
